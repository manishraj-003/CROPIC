# Integration Notes: YES-TECH and AgriStack

## Proposed Integration Touchpoints
- Farmer registry lookup via AgriStack ID mapping.
- Claim and assessment events pushed to state insurance workflows.
- NDVI and weather artifacts linked as verifiable evidence payloads.

## API Boundary Recommendations
- Keep CROPIC APIs as domain microservices.
- Provide event webhooks for claim status changes.
- Add signed audit logs for cross-system traceability.
